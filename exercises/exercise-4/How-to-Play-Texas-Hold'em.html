        <h3>Learn the Most Popular Variant: Texas Hold'em</h3>
        <p><strong>Introduction to Texas Hold'em:</strong>
            Texas Hold'em is the most
            widely played variant of poker and serves as an excellent starting point
            for new players. In this game, players receive two private cards (hole
            cards), and five community cards are placed face-up on the table. The
            objective is to form the best hand using any combination of these seven
            cards.      
        </p>
