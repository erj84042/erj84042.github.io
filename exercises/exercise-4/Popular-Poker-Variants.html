        <h3>Explore Exciting Poker Variants</h3>
        <p><strong>Introduction to Variants:</strong>
            While Texas Hold'em is the most
            popular poker variant, the world of poker offers a diverse range of games.
            Here are a few intriguing variants to consider:      
        </p>
        <p><strong>1. Omaha Hold'em:</strong>
            Similar to Texas Hold'em, but players
            receive four hole cards, and they must use exactly two of them to form
            their hand.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Seven Card Stud:</strong>
            Players receive seven cards, and the
            goal is to form the best five-card hand. Betting rounds follow each card
            dealt.      
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. Five Card Draw:</strong>
            Each player is dealt five private
            cards, and they can exchange some or all of them for new cards in an
            attempt to improve their hand.      
        </p>
        <p><strong>4. Razz:</strong>
            A lowball variant where the goal is to have the
            lowest possible hand. Straights and flushes don't count, and Aces are low.      
        </p>
        <p><strong>5. Pineapple and Crazy Pineapple:</strong>
            Variants of Hold'em
            where players receive three hole cards, but in Crazy Pineapple, one card
            must be discarded after the flop.      
        </p>
        <p><strong>6. Stud High-Low:</strong>
            A split-pot variant of Seven Card Stud
            where the highest and lowest hands share the winnings.      
        </p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
            Poker is a game of skill, strategy, and
            psychology that offers endless excitement and opportunities for
            improvement. Whether you choose to start with Texas Hold'em or explore
            other variants, poker is a game that rewards dedication and practice. Join
